<h1>Wild Games - New P2P games DApp</h1> 

<h2>10 participants - 9 winners!</h2> 
Hi, guys! We are the Wild games team and we would like to introduce you to a completely new, absolutely decentralized P2P games DApp.
We created the Wild Games platform in order to bring something new to the world of decentralized games. And….we did it!
<br><br>
At the moment we have launched two types of P2P games: Wild Five for 5 players and Hunt Ten for 10 players. In both games, 4 out of 5 participants become winners and so do 9 participants out of 10. These winners receive their deposit back and a fixed win of 20% for Wild Five and 9% for Hunt Ten. In this way, we were able to create a decentralized system of P2P games with 80% and 90% chances of winning.
<br><br>
When creating the platform, our main task was to create the opportunity of peer-to-peer interaction between players and make sure there is complete transparency of the game mechanisms. This is how the main idea of Wild Games was formed – Player vs. Players! If one player loses, other players should benefit from this and win, not any third party. 
<br><br>
Player vs. Players was implemented in our first game which we named “Hunt Ten”. It is completely different from others on the market. Out of 10 players, only one player loses, while the rest win. The second game which uses the same concept was called Wild Five. In this game four out of five players win.
The entire concept of the service is implemented in a smart contract released on the BNB Smart Chain network. We have no influence on any functions of the contract related to the interaction between users or their finances. The Wild Games platform is completely decentralized, automated and safe for every user.<br>
Decentralized automation is also one of the most important features of the platform. All transactions take place on-chain without any intermediaries or oracles. The contract determines the losing player randomly, based on the data used for entropy and immediately transfers funds to winners after the draw. You only play with each other.
<br><br>
<h2>Game mechanics</h2>
Due to decentralization, users are able to interact with each other and play games directly through a smart contract, for example, through the block explorer https://bscscan.com. However, such forms of interaction cause a lot of inconvenience.<br>
Wild Games offers a convenient form of interaction via the web service wildgames.io. Any data that you see on the pages of our service is directly from the blockchain, so we do not store anything in our database.  
<br><br>
In order to start playing, you must approve the use of funds by clicking on the “Join Game” button. This is an additional security mechanism where the user gives permission for the use of funds – only the amount of a bet in a particular game. After the transaction, the “Join Game” button will change to “Make a bet”.<br>
By clicking on the “Make a bet”, the user begins the process of making a bet. 
<br><br>
The bet amount is the same for all participants. The service will ask you to enter three digits. It can be any combination of numbers, such as 555, 893, 003, 000, etc. Entering any other character or symbols is not allowed. After the digital combination, you must confirm the entry. The data will go into the smart contract and the wallet will ask you to confirm the transaction. The digital combination will be used among other data as entropy. In this way, players are able to partially influence their own luck. 
<br><br>
That’s it! Now you’re in the game! You are assigned a Totem, which is unique for every player in the same game. You will be able to see your totem next to the totems of other players and under the “Your Totem” title. As soon as the last player enters the game, the drawing process begins and the smart contract is executed. All players except the losing player receive their bet and winnings.<br>
By clicking “Cancel bet” a player is able to withdraw their bet, however this has to occur before the last player enters the game. You should keep in mind that if you want to make a bet again, you will need to follow all the steps again.<br>
The results of the draw are displayed in the notifications for each player in the “All finished games” and “My finished games” sections. The totems change into icons for the winners and for the loser.<br>
The games in the “Open Games” section run non-stop. As soon as the last player enters a game, a new game opens and the system wait for new players. This is why participants should see the results of completed games in the notifications or in the “My finished games” section.<br>
At first it may seem that the platform is quite unusual compared to centralized systems, but these are the features of decentralization.<br>
We will constantly be improving the Wild Games platform, implementing new functions and technologies. However, complete decentralization will always be our main priority.
<br><br>
<h2>Winnings distribution</h2>
In each game there is only one losing player, while the rest are winners. All the results are calculated in a smart contract and no one is able to influence them except the participants themselves. All of them enter a three-digit combination, which becomes a part of the entropy.<br>
All players make the same bet. As soon as the loser is determined, the player loses the bet and the contract distributes it among the winners in proportions corresponding to the type of the game:
<br><br>
<b>Hunt Ten</b><br>
10 players – 9 winners<br>
81%- 9% for each of the 9 winners<br>
9% - to the fund of an additional drawing in the X9 Game<br>
1% From the size of the total gaming fund - platform fee<br>
<br><br>
<b>Wild Five</b><br>
5 players – 4 winners<br>
80% - 20% for each of the 4 winners<br>
9% - to the fund of an additional drawing in the X9 Game<br>
2% From the size of the total gaming fund - platform fee<br>
<br><br>
Prior to entering the game, players are aware of what the winning sum will be. Thus, the rules of the game are completely transparent and easy to understand.
<br><br>
<h2>X9 Game</h2>
X9 Game is an additional draw that takes place every 100 games between all losing players separately for each bet. The losses of each participant are summed up and it becomes possible to increase the chance of winning 900% of the bet amount. So, if a player loses twice with a bet of 50, the player takes 2 places out of 100.<br>
The amount of the X9 Game drawing is accumulated in the contract after each game. As soon as 100 games are completed, the contract randomly determines one winner out of 100 losers and pays the accumulated 900%. The winner’s wallet is displayed in the X9 Game Winners section of the winners table.
<br><br>
<h2>We are waiting for you!</h2>
Wild Games is still at the beginning of its journey. We will constantly be expanding the capabilities of the service and adding new games. For this, it is extremely important for us to receive feedback and we are glad to receive your opinion on the platform. If you agree with us, that decentralization is the future of all services and peer-to-peer should be the main form of interaction between users, visit our social networks: Twitter, Discord, Medium, Telegram. Stay tuned, leave comments! The development of Wild Games depends on you!
